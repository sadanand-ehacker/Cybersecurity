- sudo apt-get install tor 

- cmd -> proxychains // to check if proxychain is installed, do some edits in the file /etc/proxychains.conf
In the file u can selct proxychain types such as 'random chain', 'strict chain' etc its best to selct 'random chain', so comment
all others in the file also uncomment the line 'Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data'
Go at the bottom and the sock5 proxy as -> socks5 127.0.0.1 9050 and then save the file

- service tor start // to start tor service

- cmd -> proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com // this will start firefox browser with proxy and use duckduckgo search engine

- go to dnsleaktest.com // to check proxy and then click on button 'Standard test'

- proxychains nmap ipaddress // to use proxychain with nmap

- Alternative for Proxychains
- Copy anonsurf from github
- Go to 'kali-anonsurf' directory and run -> ./installer.sh
- cmd -> anonsurf start
- cmd -> anonsurf status // to check the anonsurf working
- cmd -> anonsurf myip // to check changed IP
- cmd -> anonsurf restart // to change IP with tor service
- cmd -> anonsurf stop // use route -n to know the gateway of the router

VPN with proxychain -.

- Go to VPNbook website then to 'OpenVPN' tab and u will see the username and password to be used for VPN
- Download the latest OpenVPN certificate bundle and unzip the file
- cmd -> openvpn vpnbook-pl226-tcp443.ovpn // to start the vpn on port 443 and then entered credentials from website and wait for the
response in the terminal sequence completed

-cmd -> killall openvpn // to diable vpn connections

then go to website -> ipleak.net to check the vpn working

- Use VPN with proxychains for better anonymity

Note -> with proxychain u can change ur IP but what if someone tries to snoop in into ur DNS, well ur DNS information will leak ur
ISP information
Open DNS makes ur browsing activity private which makes it hard to track but problem with Google DNS(8.8.8.8) is that u can't be
anonymous with it.

Cloudfare DNS service(1.1.1.1) it is will improve ur browsing speed by 25% and it is specially setup to prevent ur privacy and prevent
ur ISP from tracking ur browsing activities, most of the times DNS is selected by routers IP which can tell all ur History

Change DNS on Kali Linux ->
cmd -> vim /etc/resolv.conf and change the nameserver as 1.1.1.1

check on the 'standard test' on dnsleaktest.com the ISP should be now Cloudflare

System services ->
apache service is also known as http service
mysql service for database. ssh service

Go to location /var/www/html and then create a file 'index.html' insert text <h1>Welcome</h1>
cmd -> service apache2 start // to start service, directories for this service can be seen in /var/www/html
browser -> own_ip:80
cmd -> service apache2 stop // to stop service

ICMP -> Screenshot(502)

Zaid Anonymous ->

- every website with the Google for Facebook button will collect data about u and then create a profile on u as such websites
run a code provided by facebook and google and on the basis of that they provide adds

- the last node in the tor network u have to trust as the websites outside ounion services such as google if they enforces
https then its okay otherwise the last node person as anyone can confirure his computer to work in tor netowrk can see the
data as it is unencrypted

- tor uses noscript as javascript could be use to deanonnymize

- tor download proper verification

- cmd on tor browser -> check.torproject.org

- use plugable transports will try to make ur traffic look like any other normal traffic So when u r trying to connect a 
bridge(unplished relays not publicly avilable)as the white circles in the diagram r the tor relays about which ISP already knows
and will block ur traffic, a bridge that can use a plugable transport so this way all the traffic will not look like tor traffic

- Bypassing TOR Censorship if TOR is being blocked using Deep Packet Filtering by ur ISP ->
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-dark-web-anonymity-privacy-security-course/learn/lecture/14102980#overview

- In worst case scenerio only the ISP will know that u r using TOR but they won't be able to see which websites u r trying to going
to unless they run more active attack
- If u don't wanna u be identified as being using tor in ur country then a good option is VPN
