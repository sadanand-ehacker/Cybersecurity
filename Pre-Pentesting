Note -> with proxychain u can change ur IP but what if someone tries to snoop in into ur DNS, well ur DNS information will leak ur
ISP information
Open DNS makes ur browsing activity private which makes it hard to track but problem with Google DNS(8.8.8.8) is that u can't be
anonymous with it.

Cloudfare DNS service(1.1.1.1) it is will improve ur browsing speed by 25% and it is specially setup to prevent ur privacy and prevent
ur ISP from tracking ur browsing activities, most of the times DNS is selected by routers IP which can tell all ur History

Change DNS on Kali Linux ->
cmd -> vim /etc/resolv.conf and change the nameserver as 1.1.1.1

check on the 'standard test' on dnsleaktest.com the ISP should be now Cloudflare
