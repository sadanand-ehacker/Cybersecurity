- Websites to Practice Pentesting ->
  - AltoroMutual(online Banking Website, https://demo.testfire.net)
  - certifiedhacker.com
  -	hackthissite.org
  - hrithikrules.com

Step - Check the Webiste urself by exploring it (look for contact info and career info in website)
      - Try to look for the career tab in a website so this way u get to know what technology stacks the target organizations r
        using.

Step - Check whois info for target
  - "whois.sc" or "whois.domaintools.com" this website contains the info about the domain registrations, the registration date info, 
  hackers some time buy the domains at the time of the expiration and then resale it to the company again at very high prices bcz they
  need that domain for their buissness.
  Whois Lookup -> It is a protocol which is used to find owners of the internet resources(such as servers, IP and domain)
  Ex go to ->
  Note - if u do ping w3schools.com // u can get the IP of the application

Step -  How to know about the technologies used by the target website and other info?
        go to toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report
        
        - 'netcraft' website is used to know about the technology used by the website and also it's subsites, u can get the
          information about the organization of that website and its hosting info.

Step - 
    cmd -> msfconsole
      > help // to get list of cmds
      > use gather/search_email_collector // to start working in search_email_collector auxillary(module)
      > show options // it will list the inputs needed to execute this module
      > set DOMAIN hackthissite.org // to input value in DOMAIN variable
      > set OUTFILE hackthissite_msf_sec // to input other value to write output
      > exploit   // to launch the auxillary
      o/p - list the emails associated with the target
      
Step - Footprinting phase allows the attacker to gather the information regarding internal and external security architecture, he 
       has to face a target
       Pseudonymous Footprinting -> It includes footprinting through online sources, identity is hidden and misguided
       Internet Footprinting -> includes footprinting and reconnaissance methods for gaining information through internet such as
                                Google Hacking
       Gather information from finanacial services -> there r some Financial services powered by different search engines which
       provide financial info of international known organizations such as->
       - www.google.com/finance
       - finance.yahoo.com
       
       - "Google Hacking" means that how efficiently we can use google to do our hacking tasks such as for reconnaissance.
          - On google search use following syntaxs for better search ->
          - redmi note 5 -flipkart.com // this will not give the results from the flipkart.com
          - redmi note 5 -flipkart.com -mi.com // multiple website filtering for google search
          - redmi note 5 site:flipkart.com // this will give the result only from flipkart.com
          - Open google.com then go to settings and then Advance search and here u can set filters to do the search as u like
          - "Happy Message" this gives u the result for the both words combined otherwise the google would search and give the
            results by searching seperatly for Happy and seperatly for Message.
          - U can do the mathematical calculations in the google search
          - inurl:eccouncil // this will only show the results in whose url the eccouncil is present, now days most of the webcams
            are web based means online hence if we search the specific url for the webcam then we can access it same goes for
            printer and other perifheral devices.
            Ex: intitle: webcam 7 inurl: 8080 ,in google search and u will get the webcam results accordingly 
          - intitle:"Index Of" intext:.ftpconfig site:target_site // to find a file on the target website, this way we can also 
            check if our own website has such vulnerability or not
          - inurl: .php?id=   // to search for websites with specific url 
       
       Advance google search operators -> Screenshot(431)
       Question -> When you are collecting information to perform a data analysis, Google commands are very useful to find sensitive
       information and files. These files may contain information about passwords, system functions, or documentation. What command
       will help you to search files using Google as a search engine?
       Answer -> site:target.com filetype:xls username password email

Step - exploit-db.com // to know about vulnerabilites of certain databases and it also gives u the results on the basis of 
     ports, platforms, author etc.
    - On exploit-db.com in the left panel, go to "GHDB" for better reconnaissance using google search techniques.
    - We can also search for the vulnerable routers and get its access such as accessing router and gets the router location, 
      access webcams
      
Step - Metagoofil Metadata Tool ->
    - This tool can be used to do reconnaissance on victim website, it also uses the google database from the exploit-db.com
    - It gather and extract metadata of public docs, download the files from victim and at end it will generate a report
    - This tool works on kali linux machine
    - cmd -> apt-get install metagoofil
    - cmd -> metagoofil
    - cmd -> metagoofil -d hackthissite.org -t doc,pdf -l 200 -n 5 -o hackthissite_metagoofil -f
    
Step - It's good to collect information of the people in the organization, for this we can use "pipl.com" website and just provide
      the name or email or any other data and it will search for u about people, other websites like this is 'zabasearch.com' but
      it is only related to US, it can also provide info such as background check and property check, use other sites also like
      'linkedin' to know the professional information about people. 
     - Try to create pipl.com account -??
     
Step - Maltego tool ->




  
Target -> find which r the extra sites hosted on the server hackthissite.org and demo.te...
- email harvest not working for eccouncil.org, w3schools etc ?
