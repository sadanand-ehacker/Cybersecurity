Terminologies ->

- Hack value defines the value that whether something is worth doing it or not.

- Payload is the part of an exploit code that performs the intended malicious action. 

- In Daisy Chainning the attacker will not get the access of the particular machine but it can get an access to a machine in that
environmnet so this way the attacker can now reach to the target machine by going through the machines linked to it.

- Leaking the PII(Personal Identity Information) of an individual. 

- A software has unknown weaknesses and the developer has currently no-day knowledge means no knowledge of it but the hacker knows it
and most of the times sell it on Dark Net and exploit the software which comes as a surprise to the developer and patches r not 
available that soon or we can say that An attack that exploits the computer application vulnerabilites before the software developer
releases a patch for that vulnerability.
 
- Bots r simple softwares that can be controlled remotely to automate attacks, Ex -> DDOS attacks

- cve(common vulnerability and exploit) website provides the latest and previous vulnerabilites.

- 'securityfocus' website has a big library of vulnerabilites and not just explaining them but also provide exploits. 

- Elemets of Security : CIA Traid -> Confidentiality -> Integreity -> Availability -> Authenticity -> Non-Repudation

- Non-Repudation -> It will not allow a person to deny from the work that person has done, such as a person can not deny that
  if he has sent the mail or not.
