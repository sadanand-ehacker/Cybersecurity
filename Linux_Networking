Network Files ->

- /etc/nsswitch.conf // it is tell where to resolve ur hostname and other config files places
- /etc/hosts  // info regarding hostname
- /etc/sysconfig/network or /etc/hostname
- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-nic 
- /etc/resolv.conf


ICMP ->
- ICMP (type 11, code 0) denotes Time Exceeded
- ICMP (type 13, code 3) denotes router is blocking ICMP
- ICMP ping and ping sweeps are used to check for active systems and to check, if ICMP ping traverses a firewall
- Test-NetConnection tool for troubleshooting at transport layer, default use ICMPs
- Traceroute cmd uses UDP packets, on windows ICMP packets - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive ques 28
- mtr (linux tool) and pathping (windows tool) for same tool as traceroute
- Udemy Practice test _2 Question 48
Traceroute works by increasing the "time-to-live" value of each successive batch of packets sent. The first three packets
have a time-to-live (TTL) value of one (implying that they make a single hop). The next three packets have a TTL value of 2,
and so on. When a packet passes through a host,normally the host decrements the TTL value by one,and forwards the packet to
the next host. When a packet with a TTL of one reaches a host,the host discards the packet and sends an ICMP time exceeded
(type 11) packet to the sender. The traceroute utility uses these returning packets to produce a list of hosts that the
packets have traversed en route to the destination.

- The Ping of Death first appeared in 1996 because applications misinterpreted oversized packets.

- ip addr // for seeing IP related data

- ifconfig              // to show ethernet settings and other internet config things, if 'eth0' is their in o/p then it means
                        // their is wired connection , if u see 'wlan0' then it is wireless connected, additional ethernet
                        // connections would be shown as 'eth1' and so on
                        // 'lo' is a loop back interface which is a special interface which system uses to communicate with
                        // itself, 'inet addr' is the local are LAN address or NAT address, 'RX packets' is the received packet
                        // 'TX packet' is the transmitted packet
- ifconfig eth1         // it will now show details for 'eth1' interface only
- ifconfig eth0 up      // this will enable the internet connection
- ifconfig eth0 down    // this will disable the internet connection

- ipcalc ip_Address   // very usefull tool to understand Network segments such as Host, Network, Network Type, range etc

- 'netstat' it is a cmd line tool that is used to display network connections, routing tables and network interfaces, it can
be used to see network protocol statics
- netstat -ie // gives same output as ifconfig
- netstat -r  // to display routing table
- netstat -c // display all continous listening services
- netstat -a // display all current connections
- netstat -at | less  // this will show only tcp connections
- netstat -l | less   // this show the programs which r in listening state
- netstat -lt | less   // this will show u listening tcp connection
- netstat -lu | less   // this will show u listening udp connection
- netstat -s | less   // this will show u the statictics such as the ip packets received and delivered
- netstat -st | less  // to see statistics for the packets recived and delivered packets in tcp connection
- netstat -su | less  // to see statistics for the packets recived and delivered packets in udp connection
- netstat -p | less  // to see the pid of all connection which r available
- netstat -n | less  // to see the numberic ports which r being used by different interfaces in ur system
- netstat -an | grep  ':80'// now it will show the output for the connections with the grep entered pattern of text
- netstat -ano // it will show that which port of ur computer is connected to the port of another computer in Local Address and
Foreign Address and the if the connection is their between the local and Foreign address then the "state" would be "established"
and also tell the process ids so we can check from their that what service connection is established their such as Dropbox or
a hacker is using it. 

- impt cmd -> netstat -rnv 

- tcpdump -D // lists the interfaces which tcpdump is capable of Listening or capture from
- tcpdump -i interface_name -nn // to capture traffic on particular interface, -nn will display the ports instead of protocol 
  Ex -> http will be shown as 80 using -nn
- tcpdump -w file_name.pcap '(src src_IP and dst dst_IP) or (src src_IP and dst dst_IP)' // to capture packets on desired hosts
networks, -w is to write captured data to file with extension pcap
- tcpdump -r file_name.pcap // to read file with captured packets
- tcpdump host host_ip_address port 80 // use 'port' to define port
- tcpdump -i eth0 -v src port 443 and dst dst_IP_address // here we r defining src port and and destination IP address
- tcpdump -i eth0 tcp net 192.168.1.0/24  // to capture traffic on subnet and only show TCP data only

Note -> use tcpdump to capture traffic and wireshark to analyse traffic



 arp -a // it will list the table of IP addresses with their corresponding MAC addresses, The ARP is used to find the MAC 
 address for Known IP addresses and the RARP(Reverse ARP) is to find IP addresses for known MAC addresses

- ethtool nic_interface_name // provide info for the interface NIC

- lo // the loopback device is a special interface that ur computer uses to communicate with itself, It is mainly used for diagnostics
and troubleshooting, and to connect to servers running on the local machine

# NIC Bonding -> NIC  bonding is also known as network bonding, It can be defined as the aggregation or combination of multiple NIC
into a single bond interface, It's main purpose is to provide high availability and redundancy

If u combine two NIC of 1 GB then it will provide 2GB and if one fails the other would be still working, Screenshot(529)

NIC bonding Procedure ->
- modprobe bonding -> it is to get the configuration of ur driver
- modinfo bonding -> to get the info of ur bonding
- Create the file -> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0 then edit file -> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet1
and file -> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet2
then u point the 1st edit and 2nd edit ethernet files to ifcfg-bond0 
then restart the network via cmd -> systemctrl restart network, Screenshot(530)
