- DaRT(Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset) tool kit can be used to delete the SAM file in Windows

- Microsoft baseline security analyzer -> this program will tell u what u r doing wrong and find the weak spots before attacker do.

- Password and Registry Editor - ?? -> https://academy.ehacking.net/courses/550930/lectures/9988055

- 'chntpw' is a software utility for reseting or blanking local passwords used by Windows, it does this by editing the SAM database
where windows stores password hashes.

Ques -> You've gained physical access to a Windows 2008 R2 server which has an accessible disc drive. When you attempt to boot the 
server and log in, you are unable to guess the password. In your tool kit you have an Ubuntu 9.10 Linux Live CD. Which Linux based
tool has the ability to change any user's password or to activate disabled Windows accounts?
Ans -> chntpw

#(2) Immutable Laws of Security -> Screenshot(329)

Law 1 -> If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it's not solely your computer anymore. Screenshot(331, 333)

Law 2 -> If a bad guy can alter the operating system on your computer, it's not your computer anymore. Screenshot(334, 335)

- edlin.exe from Windows Vista is a cmd line editor, only few people knew that this file existed. If some one manages to modify the
file edlin.exe it means that the person has trusted installed permission and that person can easily cover up his actions as well.

Law 3 -> If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to ur computer, it's not your computer anymore. Screenshot(337, 338)

Law 4 -> If u allow a bad guy to run active content on ur website or online application, it's not ur website anymore. Screenshot(339)

Law 5 -> Weak passwords trump strong security. Screenshot(340, 341)

Law 6 -> A computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy. Screenshot(342)

Law 7 -> Encrypted data is only as secure as its decryption key. Screenshot(343)

Law 8 -> An out of date malware scanner is only marginally better than no malware scanner at all. Screenshot(344, 345, 346)

Law 9 -> Absolute anonymity isn't practically achievable, online or offline. Screenshot(348, 349)
