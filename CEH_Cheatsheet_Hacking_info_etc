#(01) CEH Ports

0 to 1023 – well known ports assigned to common protocols and services
1024 to 49151 – registered ports assigned by ICANN to a specific service// ICANN(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
49152 to 65535 – dynamic (private, high) ports range from 49152 to 65535. Can be used by any service on an ad-hoc basis. Ports are

FTP - 20,21
SSH/SCP/SFTP - 22 // SCP(Secure Copy Protocol) -> The SCP is a network protocol, based on the BSD RCP protocol, which supports file
    transfers between hosts on a network. SCP uses Secure Shell (SSH) for data transfer and uses the same mechanisms for authentication
    , thereby ensuring the authenticity and confidentiality of the data in transit.
    // SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a secure version of File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which facilitates data access and data
    transfer over a Secure Shell (SSH) data stream. It is part of the SSH Protocol. This term is also known as SSH File Transfer
    Protocol

    Question -> You have successfully gained access to your client's internal network and successfully comprised a Linux server which
                is part of the internal IP network. You want to know which Microsoft Windows workstations have file sharing enabled.

    Answer -> 445
    
    Question -> Eve is spending her day scanning the library computers. She notices that Alice is using a computer whose port 445
                is active and listening. Eve uses the ENUM tool to enumerate Alice machine. From the command prompt, she types the
                following command.
                What is Eve trying to do?
    Answer -> Eve is trying to carry out a password crack for user Administrator
    
    Question -> Null sessions are un-authenticated connections (not using a username or password.) to an NT or 2000 system.
                Which TCP and UDP ports must you filter to check null sessions on your network?
    Answer -> 139 and 445
SNMP - 161 UDP // SNMP is a network management protocol that is usually set up to use UDP instead of TCP packets
SNMP Trap(Asynchronous) - 162 TCP/UDP
LDAP - 389 TCP/UDP // 
    Question -> An LDAP directory can be used to store information similar to a SQL database. LDAP uses a ____ database structure
                instead of SQL’s ______ structure. Because of this, LDAP has difficulty representing many-to-one relationships.
    Answer   -> Hierarchical, Relational
LDAP(SSL/TLS) - 636

SYSLOG - 514 //specifically designed for transporting event messages, needed in order to send log messages to a log analysis tool 
    that resides behind a firewall
    Question -> You are a Network Security Officer. You have two machines. The first machine (192.168.0.99) has snort installed, and
                the second machine (192.168.0.150) has kiwi syslog installed. You perform a SYN scan in your network, and you notice
                that kiwi syslog is not receiving the alert message from snort. You decide to run Wireshark in the snort machine to
                check if the messages are going to the kiwi syslog machine.
                What Wireshark filter will show the connections from the snort machine to kiwi syslog machine?
    Answer -> tcp.dstport==514&&ip.dst==192.168.0.150
    
    Syslog is a standard for logging program msgs. It allows seperation of the software that generate msgs from the system that 
    stores them and the softwares that reports and analyzes them. It also provide devices, which woul otherwise be unable to
    communicate a means to notify administrators of problems of performance.

Global Catlog Service - 3268 TCP/UDP

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer (layer 2) communications protocol between two routers directly without any host 
or any other networking in between. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption, and compression.
In PPP the layout of the PPP port parameters changes considerably according to the used lower layer port type such as
PPP over SYNC LOWPO -> 1
PPP over Frame-Relay LOWPO -> 101
PPP over ISDN LOWPO -> 17
PPP over EIR(S-link) LOWPO -> 200
PPP over EIR(P-link) LOWPO -> 200
LOWPO is Identifier of the lower level Abilis CPX port (1 - 999, NONE)
Sets the lower level port; it can be any P-LINK or an S-LINK port.
The value "NONE" makes the PPP port unusable.

WMI - // Windows Management Instrumentation is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and
    applications in a network from Windows computing systems.
// This issue can occur when the default configuration of the Windows Firewall program blocks incoming network traffic for
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) connection. For the connection to succeed, the remote computer must permit incoming
network traffic on TCP ports 135, 445, and additional dynamically-assigned ports, typically in the range of 1024 to 1034.
