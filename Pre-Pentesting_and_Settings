 Hiding Identity ->
Proxy Servers -> Screenshot(9), It's hard to find the identity of a hacker, We can use Tor browser for this task, tor
actually transfers ur data or request from multiple proxies(proxy chain) which makes it difficult to trace back the real user.
Tor browser will only hide when u r browsing some website but not if u r using system it won't help u.

To configure a local proxy server->
- We use a program "proxy workbench"
- download "proxy workbench" on machine 1, then run it on machine 1 // if we have this program on another machine also then
  we can also make a proxy chain
- now connect to machine 2 //look through the tutorial video for configuration

Using Public Proxy ->
- We use a tool for this task "Proxy Switcher", it hides ur IP address from the websites u visit.
- Note -> Exam will have few questions about specific tool, they will ask what is this tool doing # CEH_exam_imp
- Exam could ask u about few tools and proxy switcher is one of them # CEH_exam_imp
- download "proxy switcher", u do not need to change any configuration for this
- a list will appear of the available proxy servers, and select one of them

- Never Run tor as root user

- In NoScript extension always select the option 'Forbid Scripts Globally' before proceeding to tor

- search on google as socks5 list

- sudo apt-get install tor 

- cmd -> proxychains // to check if proxychain is installed, do some edits in the file /etc/proxychains.conf
In the file u can selct proxychain types such as 'random chain', 'strict chain' etc its best to selct 'random chain', so comment
all others in the file also uncomment the line 'Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data'
Go at the bottom and the sock5 proxy as -> socks5 127.0.0.1 9050 and then save the file

- service tor start // to start tor service

- cmd -> proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com // this will start firefox browser with proxy and use duckduckgo search engine

- go to dnsleaktest.com // to check proxy and then click on button 'Standard test'

- proxychains nmap ipaddress // to use proxychain with nmap

- Alternative for Proxychains
- Copy anonsurf from github
- Go to 'kali-anonsurf' directory and run -> ./installer.sh
- cmd -> anonsurf start
- cmd -> anonsurf status // to check the anonsurf working
- cmd -> anonsurf myip // to check changed IP
- cmd -> anonsurf restart // to change IP with tor service
- cmd -> anonsurf stop // use route -n to know the gateway of the router

VPN with proxychain -.

- Go to VPNbook website then to 'OpenVPN' tab and u will see the username and password to be used for VPN
- Download the latest OpenVPN certificate bundle and unzip the file
- cmd -> openvpn vpnbook-pl226-tcp443.ovpn // to start the vpn on port 443 and then entered credentials from website and wait for the
response in the terminal sequence completed

-cmd -> killall openvpn // to diable vpn connections

then go to website -> ipleak.net to check the vpn working

- Use VPN with proxychains for better anonymity

Note -> with proxychain u can change ur IP but what if someone tries to snoop in into ur DNS, well ur DNS information will leak ur
ISP information
Open DNS makes ur browsing activity private which makes it hard to track but problem with Google DNS(8.8.8.8) is that u can't be
anonymous with it.

Cloudfare DNS service(1.1.1.1) it is will improve ur browsing speed by 25% and it is specially setup to prevent ur privacy and prevent
ur ISP from tracking ur browsing activities, most of the times DNS is selected by routers IP which can tell all ur History

Change DNS on Kali Linux ->
cmd -> vim /etc/resolv.conf and change the nameserver as 1.1.1.1

check on the 'standard test' on dnsleaktest.com the ISP should be now Cloudflare

System services ->
apache service is also known as http service
mysql service for database. ssh service

Go to location /var/www/html and then create a file 'index.html' insert text <h1>Welcome</h1>
cmd -> service apache2 start // to start service, directories for this service can be seen in /var/www/html
browser -> own_ip:80
cmd -> service apache2 stop // to stop service

ICMP -> Screenshot(502)

- macchanger // this cmd is used to change the MAC address
   macchanger -s interface	// to see the address
   macchanger -a interface  // to mask the MAC address with another MAC address, use '-r' for random address 
   macchanger -p interface 	// to change it back to the original MAC address

- visit bwatcher.lart.info/tools/mac.cgi - ??    // for MAC lookup

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zaid Anonymous ->

- every website with the Google for Facebook button will collect data about u and then create a profile on u as such websites
run a code provided by facebook and google and on the basis of that they provide adds

Screenshot(512)

- the last node in the tor network u have to trust as the websites outside ounion services such as google if they enforces
https then its okay otherwise the last node person as anyone can confirure his computer to work in tor netowrk can see the
data as it is unencrypted

- tor uses noscript as javascript could be use to deanonnymize

- tor download proper verification 
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-dark-web-anonymity-privacy-security-course/learn/lecture/14090086#overview

- cmd on tor browser -> check.torproject.org

- use plugable transports will try to make ur traffic look like any other normal traffic So when u r trying to connect a 
bridge(unplished relays not publicly avilable)as the white circles in the diagram r the tor relays about which ISP already knows
and will block ur traffic, a bridge that can use a plugable transport so this way all the traffic will not look like tor traffic

- Bypassing TOR Censorship if TOR is being blocked using Deep Packet Filtering by ur ISP ->
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-dark-web-anonymity-privacy-security-course/learn/lecture/14102980#overview

- In worst case scenerio only the ISP will know that u r using TOR but they won't be able to see which websites u r trying to going
to unless they run more active attack
- If u don't wanna u be identified as being using tor in ur country then a good option is VPN

- Screenshot(516, 518) // for VPN with tor as it provides more privacy and anonymity and bypass censorship as the VPN has added a extra
layer of encryption which makes the service provider or Government to not see what data u sending or accessing
In worst case scenerio for Pluggable and Bridges the government can see that u r trying to use tor and in case of using VPN and then
tor the worst case scenerio is that they can only see that u r accessing VPN, and enforce using VPN+TLS

- Never use tor in full screen as it identifies what kind of laptop u r using
- on the right top side of tor browser click on onion icon then "Check for Tor Browser updates" always look for updates
- click on browser 'i' icon to see the tor circuit with 3 relays, click on 'New Circuit' for new IP and new circuit for relays
- on the right top side of tor browser click on onion icon then "New Identity" the whole browser cache, history and data would be
deleted and the browser will restart with fresh circuit while the 'New Circuit' option would change the identity for the website
accessing at the moment only
- on the right top side of tor browser click on onion icon then "Tor Network Settings" for adding Bridges if tor is censored
in ur conuntry, add ports if u think ISP is allowing only specific ports such as 80,443 and this will let u bypass some firewalls
and u can also add proxy
- Go to 'Preferences' of tor browser, go to 'Privacy and Secucrity' and select for 'History' as 'Never Remember' and then tracking 
protection to always, block pop up, check box 'Prevent asseccibility services...', select 'Safest' and then check 'Block dangerous
and deceptive content all' // these settings will break some websites as we r going for the maximum security
- use website 'panopticlick' for checking the security tests for the browser u r using at the bottom u will see that it is showing
the bites amount of information to identify u via browser and also the data in table about u more the bites more the data to identify
u using browser

- Information Theory -> Screenshot(519) // to identify a person as only 32.8 bits of information is sufficient

- Tor Browser using disadvantages on normal OS -> Screenshot(520)

- Tails -s live as it is installed on usb or dvd and can be used on any system regardless of what OS is on it, and anything u do
on that system will be directly connected to tor network hence no data leakage and tails also never touch storage of ur computer as
it only RAM therefore the data is temporaryly stored on RAM so it leaves no traces
