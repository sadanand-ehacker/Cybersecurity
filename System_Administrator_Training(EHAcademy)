Soft and Hard Links -> Screenshot(358)
to create a soft link use cmd -> ln -s full_path_to_file // to verify if link is done to ls -al and u will see that the filename is
directing to the path of the file, now if u will do the change in the original file then the link file would be also change accordingly
ls -li // to list the inodes
The inodes for the soft link is different from the original file of which it is link and if the original file is deleted the content
in the soft link will also not appear as the file is removed but in hard link even if the original file is removed the hard link file
still show the content.
Note for hard link -> Screenshot(359)
When a hard link is created it would not be shown as 'link' in details instead shown as normal file and also when u do ls -al u will
not see the filename is directing to the path of the file like in soft link
